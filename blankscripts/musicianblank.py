    - __init__()
    - __str__()
    - __eq__(self, other) is the equivalent of Java equals() and should be overridden in classes
    - __dict__ attribute of all objects

    # Using properties in those situations can make the code unnecessarily verbose, confusing and slower
    # than code based on regular attributes.

    # Run setters and getters in the debugger
